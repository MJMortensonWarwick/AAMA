        "We have already defined a likelihood (the coin flip data we generated with the _stats.bernoulli.rvs()_ function) and a prior (a beta distribution with $\\alpha$=2 and $\\beta$=2). Our analysis will generate the posterior so we needn't define it - the posterior will always be the same distribution as the likelihood so in this case a Bernoulli distribution. This only leaves the evidence ($P(B)$). I say _only_ but as suggested earlier this is always the difficult bit. In fact our problem is simple enough that we could compute the integral, but often this would be intractable or too practically difficult to achieve. Accordingly we will instead use a common cheat _Markov Chain Monte Carlo_ methods (MCMC).\n",
        "\n",
        "The trick here is that instead of bothering with $P(B)$ we instead uses MCMC to simply estimate the posterior. Ultimately the evidence is only the denominator, and only there to normalise the numerator ($P(B|A)~P(A)$) to a scale between 0 and 1. MCMC, for reasons we will briefly touch upon, is an approach designed to estimate hard-to-estimate distributions ... which is effectively the task we have when estimating a non-normalised posterior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Monte Carlo methods (the second \"MC\" in \"MCMC\") are methods for generating random data. In this problem, ultimately we want to generate the value of the real $\\theta$ value ... the probability of getting a heads on an individual coin toss. Being a probability we know this value must be between 0 and 1. So our Monte Carlo sampler just needs to generate values between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "But how does generating a bunch of random numbers get us any closer to estimating our posterior distribution I hear you ask? This is where the first \"MC\" comes in ... Markov chains. We have already seen these in the previous module as a method for estimating the probability of changes of state. In our slide example this was weather and transitioning between rain, sunshine and snow. In essence, Markov chains are about calculating the most next likely next state given our current one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trick with an MCMC sampler is that when we draw random numbers (the Monte Carlo part) we are able to make some estimate on how likely/probable they are given we know they should directly represent some normalised multiplication of values in the likelihood ($P(B|A)$) and prior ($P(A)$). As we step through our Markov chain (often called a random walk), we randomly guess a next step (Monte Carlo). We then have some kind of accept/reject criteria (this varies by algorithm - here we use [NUTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246)) where we look at probability of the random draw. If we \"accept\" the random guess then it can be added as the next step of our Markov chain. If we do this enough times (1,000s typically) we will start to find we get lots of samples around the same area (which then forms our posterior), as this is ultimately the area which the numerator makes the samples most probable.\n",

        "Let's try a metaphor! A game often played by kids in the UK (or at least played by kids in the UK when I was a kid in the UK, which is not recent times I'll admit) is \"hot or cold\". The idea of the game is that the guesser has to find an item in the room and they start with zero knowledge where it might be. The helper gives them relative advice as to whether they are getting closer or further away from the item. The guesser will start at an (effectively) random point in the room and the helper will give them a clue as to how close they are. Let's assume they are far from the item so the helper will say they are \"cold\". The guesser will then step towards a different point in the room. Assuming they have now got closer to the item, the helper will say \"warmer\". If they then take a misstep away from the item they will be told they are now \"colder\". Eventually by following the chain with the most \"warmers\" they will get to a point where the helper tells them they are \"hot\" or \"very hot\" and they find the item.\n",
        "\n",
        "This illustrates how an MCMC sampler might work. As with the metaphor we are looking for an item we cannot see (the posterior distribution/real $\\theta$ value) and we start off with some random guesswork (Monte Carlo). While we are never told if we are right or wrong, we can evaluate a potential step and get advice as to whether this is acceptable/\"warm\" or rejected/\"cold\". In MCMC this \"advice\" comes from simply consulting our likelihood and prior distributions which contain all the information on the probability of any direction, just unfortunately they are not scaled/normalised correctly. By staying on the \"warmer\" path and ignoring \"colder\" missteps, we end up with in a part of the room where everything is hot and very close to the item (parameters) we are looking for. Play the game long enough and you will find your item / find a good set of data from which to draw a histogram of our desired posterior distribution!  \n",
        "\n",
        "If that's still confusing then let's just boil it down to the following:\n",
        "1. We (often) cannot calculate the posterior distribution, $P(A|B)$, because the denominator of Bayes' Theorem, $P(B)$, is often intractable (hard or impossible to calculate);\n",
        "2. $P(B)$, however, is just the denominator and is only used to scale the numerator, $P(B|A)~P(A)$, between 0 and 1 (a probability). The numerator tells us a lot about the likely values in the posterior!\n",
        "3. MCMC offers a solution to this by using a random sampler to guess the posterior. Although we don't know what the right values are (we don't know the real posterior) we can use the numerator to evaluate each possible value suggested by the sampler. Based on some acceptance/rejection algorithm, we only keep the ones which are most likely.\n",
        "4. By only keeping the more likely guesses, we end up with a bunch of data points that are a good approximation of the posterior distribution.\n",

Perhaps surprisingly we can see that although we only asked for 5,000 samples we actually produced 12,000. There are a few reasons for this.\n",

        "Firstly, the algorithm has built 2x separate MCMC chains rather than just 1x. The reason why it is beneficial to build multiple is that we are effectively building random pathways and a single one of these can get stuck into some local optima. Across multiple we are more likely to get a better set of averages.\n",

        "Secondly we note that the 2x chains comprise \"1,000 tune and 5,000 draw iterations\". This means that it does 1,000 random guesses to get the chain into a good initial position before it starts actually saving the data. The 1,000 tuning iterations are effectively a warm-up.\n",

We will talk about _r\\_hat_ (i.e. $\\hat{R}$). This tells us how consistent the (in the case 2x) chains are. A score of 1. is ideal suggesting that the chains all behave similarly ... a measure of confidence in our result. _mcse\\_mean_ and _mcse\\_sd_ refer to Monte Carlo Standard Error Mean/Standard Deviation and are both low supporting this.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we are more interested in the first four elements which are also represented in our chart. We have a mean value in the posterior of 0.376 ... very close to our real $\\theta$ value of 0.35. Great news ... our model has done its job. The distribution has standard deviation of 0.162. Finally we have _hdi\\_3%_ and _hdi\\_97%_ (where HDI stands for High Density Interval). This is basically the range of values we will consider in our distribution as we ignore the bottom and top 3% as potential noise. This is comparable to the frequentist notion of a confidence interval, typically called a credible interval in Bayesian terminology ... roughly saying we are 94% confident the true average of this distribution is between 0.086 and 0.67.\n",
